Two files are provided.

`users.csv` contains a list of users with unique user_id, user signup_date, and user type (enterprise or individual). 

*Note*:  The type of user is self-identified and is not necessarily factual (an individual user can claim to be enterprise, an enterprise user can claim to be individual, and the distinction has no other formal definition).

`ops.csv` contains a log of user actions with operation time, user id, operation count (multiple operations can be aggregated into one row), and response status.

Please:
- Describe and visualize the data
- Think of one interesting business question you can answer with this data, and try to answer it
- Explain what you would do with more time, and any other data you would request

Code in python. Use any libraries you want.
